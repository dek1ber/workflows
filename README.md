# VM Workflows

This is a personalized set of bootstrap scripts designed to let me quickly set up a VM environment. To run this project, all you have to do is:

```bash
chmod +x workflows/setup.sh
./workflows/setups.sh
```

I currently have 5 different "workflows" set up:
- Debian-based penetration testing workflow with extensive github projects + preferred packages 
- Debian-based penetration testing workflow with preferred packages 
- Ubuntu-based development workflow with preferred packages (both apt and pip) + personal dotfiles 
- Fedora-based development workflow with preferred packages (both dnf and pip) + personal dotfiles 
- BSD-based development workflow with preferred packages + personal dotfiles 

## BE CAREFUL 
The full pentest workflow (option 1) will take a while to do (due to the number of github repos), AND will overwrite data in your /opt/tools directory!!!
